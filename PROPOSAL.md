#Proposal on Project Idea
I want to create a game like *Pac-Man*, *Space Invaders*, or collecting/avoiding items kind of game. My idea consists of
avoiding certain obstacles while collecting other objects game.
Capitalism Simulator: you control a sprite that runs around collecting "coins" and avoiding bombs.

Arcade games and similar games have straightforward designs that are addicting to play. There's also a lot of history
behind arcade games and have always wanted to emulate it within code. It's also a step in a direction of wanting to try
and understand game development. My biggest motivation to complete this project is that I have always wanted to create 
a game of some sort.

###Possible External Libraries to be Added

 The external library I plan to include is the SQLite Modern CPP and SQLite3 that was with the Snake to aid with a
 database creation. I may try and add in the suBox2D Cinder Block too.

###Timeline on Project
Week One:
- [X] Create a class for the objects to be used class involved in the game.
- [X] Work out a general outline for how I want the player to interact with the game.
- [X] Complete key-binding for movements and actions

Week Two: 
- [X] Complete the main running system for the project
- [X] Work out a scoring system
- [X] Create a database for the scores

Week Three:
- [X] Make it kind of aesthetically pleasing
- [X] Add sounds
- [X] Figure out how naming will work
- [X] Tie it all together

###Stretch Goals
I may want to add a second entity for the user to control. Making different speed settings, themes to the game, and
possibly make a combination of one main game and a secondary mini game. If I do create a second mini game, it will most
likely just be like a reflex test of some sort.
